# Class Creation:
# Create a class named Car. Define it with basic attributes like make, model, and year. Initialize an object of this class and print its attributes.
# class car:
#     def __init__( self, make, model, year) :
#         self.make = 
#         self. model = model
#         self.year = year

# Object Methods:
# Add a method called start_engine to the Car class that prints a message indicating the engine has started. Call this method for the previously created object.

# Constructor Method:
# Modify the Car class to include a constructor method that initializes the make, model, and year attributes when an object is created. Create a new object using this constructor.

# Default Values in Constructor:
# Extend the Car class to have default values for the make and model attributes in the constructor. Create an object without providing values for these attributes.

# Multiple Objects:
# Create three different Car objects, each with different make, model, and year values. Print the details of each car.

# Destructor and Cleanup:
# Destructor Method:
# Add a destructor method to the Car class that prints a message when a car object is deleted. Delete one of the car objects and observe the message.

# Object Cleanup:
# Create a class called Person with attributes name and age. Add a method to the class that prints the person's details. Create a Person object, print its details, and then delete the object.

# Simple Object Cleanup
# Create a class called Task with an attribute description representing a task. Implement a method called complete that prints a message when the task is marked as complete. When you no longer need a task object, call a method cleanup that prints a message simulating the cleanup of resources associated with the task. Delete the task object and observe the cleanup message.
# Constructors and Initialization:
# Parameterized Constructor:
# Create a class named Rectangle with attributes length and width. Include a constructor that accepts values for length and width when an object is created. Create an object using this parameterized constructor.

# Constructor Overloading:
# Modify the Rectangle class to include constructor overloading. Implement a default constructor that sets both length and width to 1 if no values are provided. Create objects using both the parameterized and default constructors.
